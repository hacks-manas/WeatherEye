:construction_worker_man: DEVELOPMENTS AHEAD

~~[ ] v0.2 - Scraping twitter data for weather sentiments of the same location~~<br />
~~[ ] v0.3 - Filtering weather sentiments categorically~~ <br />

---
> The concept for scraping twitter is flawed : 
- Twitter does not contain enough data to sentiment analyze about a certain location on a certain date.
- The data might occasionally contain weather related accidents thus making the model prone to outliers.
- There would be a lot many filters to deal with turning the project into a ML project

> Also switching the API from openweather to accu weather 
- It offers better results (as tested)
